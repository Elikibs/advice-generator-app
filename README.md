# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview
The Advice Generator is a web application that provides users with random pieces of advice by clicking a dice icon. It aims to offer a simple and engaging user experience, delivering helpful or amusing advice to users on-demand. I have used advice api below; https://api.adviceslip.com/advice

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
